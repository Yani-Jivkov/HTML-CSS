        <h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
        <p>The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different groups of plants:
        by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for sunlight. Trees
        tend to be tall and long-lived, some reaching several thousand years
        old. Several trees are among the oldest organisms now living.
        Trees have modified structures such as thicker stems composed of
        specialised cells that add structural strength and durability,
        allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to spread
        out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar
        growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main
        system; but there is no consistent distinction between a tree
        and a shrub, made more confusing by the fact that trees may be
        reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains
        and subarctic areas. The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of
        plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example
        of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the number of
        trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living plant species.
        The greatest number of these grow in tropical regions; many of these areas
         have not yet been fully surveyed by botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.
